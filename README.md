## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucas! Iâ€™m a web developer based in the Greater Toronto Area.

I specialize in translating challenging prototypes and designs into delightful React interfaces. Having dabbled in the MERN stack, I am interested in expanding my full stack development skills. I also enjoy leading product demos and taking an active role in the Scrum workflow. As a former anthropologist, I am very much focused on the human side of technology.
