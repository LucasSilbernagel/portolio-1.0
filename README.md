## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucas! I’m a web developer based in the Greater Toronto Area.

My specialties include:
  - Full stack development with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js
  - Translating beautiful and challenging designs into delightful and responsive user experiences
  - Conducting web accessibility reviews and implementing improvements to meet WCAG standards
  - Custom theme development for WordPress and Shopify
  - Wireframing and prototyping with Figma

In 2020 I graduated from web development bootcamp at Juno College, prior to which I earned a Master’s degree in sociocultural anthropology from the University of Toronto. As a former anthropologist, I am very much focused on the human side of technology.

My previous experience in sales and customer service has proved invaluable, as I am highly skilled in client management, technical troubleshooting, digital content management, and providing training to clients and colleagues.
